# Lab 5: Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Student Version

## Overview
In this lab I simulated real-world access control by assigning roles to another student's account on a new resource group. Azure RBAC is used to manage who can perform actions like view, edit, deploy, or delete resources.

## Steps Performed
- Created Resource Group: `Lab5-RBAC-RG`
- Viewed current access level using IAM
- Assigned additional role: Reader
- Simulated real-world RBAC testing without a second user
- Cleaned up all resources after the lab

## Notes
- Azure for Students doesn’t support creating new users in Azure AD therefore I could not creat a new user.
